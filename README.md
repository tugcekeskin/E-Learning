# E-Learning-Platform

Parallel to the development of technology, ways of obtaining information have changed.
Technological tools that are always with individuals increase the use of e-learning tools because they made it very easy to access literal.
The variety of courses, free or affordable courses, being accessible from the desired location, freedom in timing, and internationally recognized courses are other reasons for the tendency to this field.

The aim of this project is to create an e-learning program similar to the outside world.
This project has been turned into a platform that can be used by learners and instructors.
It is designed in such a way that students can see all the courses they have purchased, buy a course (see the price, language and number of purchases of the course they want to buy), spending money on each course they buy and see the amount of money they have; while the instructors can add new courses to their current courses, earn money from each course they teach and see the amount of money they have.

•	Learner.cpp
•	Lecture.h

Text Files: to keep information about users and courses
